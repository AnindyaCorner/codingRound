In the first version of my project, I have simply made modifications so that the tests are passed and only few 
changes to the code. For this purpose i have created a maven project and placed the test classes inside src/test/
java instead of src/main/java folder because maven runs only the test classes placed in the test folder.

Changes made to FlightBookingTest.java:
Driver path has to be set before launching the browser otherwise we will get IllegalStateException. I have made that
change by placing setDriverPath() before launching the browser.

I have increased the waiting time for AutoSuggestions to load otherwise we will get NoSuchElementException.

I have changed the locator strategy of picking the date from xpath by index to independent-dependent xpath which is 
more reliable.

Changes made to HotelBookingTest.java:
Driver path has to be set before launching the browser otherwise we will get IllegalStateException. I have made that
change by placing setDriverPath() before launching the browser.
In the original code, we have not initialized the WebElements to their addresses given by their locators i.e. we have
not used PageFactory.initElements(driver,this). If we don't use this then we will get NullPointerException. I have 
added this step in the program.

Changes made to SignInTest.java:
Driver path has to be set before launching the browser otherwise we will get IllegalStateException. I have made that
change by placing setDriverPath() before launching the browser.
After clicking on 'Your trips' and then clicking on sign in option, a frame opens up. We need to switch to this frame
before we perform any operation inside elements inside that frame. If we don't switch to that frame and try to perfo
rm actions on its elements, we will get NoSuchElementException. To resolve this i have included a line where i have
switched to this frame using driver.switchTo.frame(frameid).

Driver executable file:
I have placed the driver executable file of chrome inside drivers folder under the project and suitably changed the 
code to point to that driver executable file.

pom.xml:
I have removed Junit dependency from pom.xml as we are not using it.
